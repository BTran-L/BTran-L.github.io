                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>RELEX Solutions provides space and assortment management software for major retail chains. The project involved redesigning the planogram management interface to optimize workflows for retail planners working with clients including US Foods, Circle K, Wesco, and Casey's.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Retail planners were spending excessive time on repetitive tasks within the planogram management system. The existing interface was complex, with steep learning curves for new users and inefficient workflows for experienced users managing large-scale retail floor plans.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>As a UX Designer, I was responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducting customer research and shadowing sessions</li>
                        <li>Analyzing existing workflows and pain points</li>
                        <li>Designing matrix task components and accessibility improvements</li>
                        <li>Creating and testing interactive prototypes</li>
                        <li>Collaborating with QFactory accessibility consultants</li>
                        <li>Working closely with Product Managers and development teams</li>
                        <li>Establishing design handoff processes using Figma</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>I employed the VIBE design methodology, conducting extensive customer shadowing sessions and concept co-design workshops with retail planners from major clients. This hands-on approach ensured solutions were grounded in real user needs.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Features Designed</h3>
                    <p><strong>Matrix Task Components:</strong> Redesigned complex data tables to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant while maintaining the power and flexibility required by professional users.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Floor Planning Tools:</strong> Streamlined the planogram creation and editing workflow, reducing the time needed to create floor plans by 50%.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>OTG (On-The-Go) Features:</strong> Mobile-optimized views for store visits and on-site planogram verification.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>The redesigned interface reduced training time for new users by 60% and improved task completion speed by 45% for experienced users. Accessibility improvements ensured compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, making the platform usable for all team members.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Customer Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Post-launch customer research programs revealed high satisfaction scores, with users particularly appreciating the simplified workflows and improved accessibility. The design has become a key differentiator for RELEX in the competitive retail software market.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>Working with enterprise software taught me the importance of balancing power-user needs with accessibility. Complex interfaces can be both powerful and usable when designed thoughtfully with diverse user needs in mind.</p>
